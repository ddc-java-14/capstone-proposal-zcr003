## Summary

My proposed capstone project is an app for live music lovers that are interested in finding out information about a venue in general or one they're attending.

This application would allow users to search for their favorite venues/find new venues across the country (maybe just ABQ to start) and access information such as: Business hours, Food options, Alcohol selection, Security policies, Current entertainment offerings, Nearby hotels, Hot spots, and much more! 



## Intended users

- A user that is following their favorite band and travelling to a city for their first time.

>My favorite band, Phish, is always travelling to new cities and venues, and I don't know where to begin in a new city. I want an app that gives me info about the city/venue I'm visiting in one concise place so I don't have to individually search for all that information. 


- A local that is looking for a new place to see music and get out for a night. 

> As a local music lover, I'm always looking for new exciting venues and events to attend. I want an app that tells me new venues to check out and maybe some new info about the ones I regularly attend without having to put in too much effort.









## Client component

### Functionality

A user will be able to search for a nearby venue or for one of their choosing. Once a venue is found it will be shown on a map along with other nearby venues, food, hot spots, etc. The user will be able to navigate through menus that explain information about the venue, along with other relevant info. The user will be able to add frequented venues to a favorites folder and get updates from their favorite venues.  



### Persistent data

List the content that will be stored on the client side. This should include any information that a user of your system should expect to be maintained locally (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use, on a single device. 
    
### Device/external services

If the client component will need to access special services of the device (e.g. sensors, contacts, messaging), list them here. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. real-time weather data, Open Trivia Database), those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.
    
## Server component

### Functionality

List the key functional aspects that will be provided by the server component---i.e. tell us what parts of the system functionality will be performed by the server.

### Persistent data

List the content that will be stored on the server side. This should include any information that a user of your system should expect to be accessible across multiple sessions of use, even if accessed from separate devices. In addition, if there will be data originating from some users that will then be accessible by other users, it should be part of the persistent data on the server. 
    
### External services

If the server component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. stock prices, Open Movie Database), those should also be listed here. Any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.
    
## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
