## Summary

My proposed capstone project is an app for live music lovers that are interested in finding out information about a venue they are attending/in general.

This application would allow users to search for their favorite venues/find new venues across the country (maybe just ABQ to start) and access information such as: Business hours, Food options, Alcohol selection, Security policies, Current entertainment offerings, Nearby hotels, Hot spots, and much more! 



## Intended users

- A user that is following their favorite band and travelling to a city for their first time.

>My favorite band, Phish, is always travelling to new cities and venues, and I don't know where to begin in a new city. I want an app that gives me info about the city/venue I'm visiting in one concise place so I don't have to individually search for all that information. 


- A local that is looking for a new place to see music and get out for a night. 

> As a local music lover, I'm always looking for new exciting venues and events to attend. I want an app that tells me new venues to check out and maybe some new info about the ones I regularly attend without having to put in too much effort.









## Client component

### Functionality

A user will be able to search for a nearby venue or for one of their choosing. Once a venue is found it will be shown on a map with information about the venue such as hours, whether they serve food, alcohol selection, etc. along with other nearby venues, food, and hot spots. The user will be able to navigate through menus that explain information about the venue, along with other relevant info. The user will be able to add frequented venues to a favorites folder and get updates from their favorite venues.



### Persistent data
- Persisting previous site activity (e.g. storing the contents of a previous session, remembering if a user was previously logged in).
- Potentially saving some data and assets locally so a site will be quicker to download, or be usable without a network connection.
- Saving web application generated documents locally for use offline such as direction to the venue.
